# Control Raspberry Pi's GPIO via MQTT

## Introduction

This is a client demo for our concept of IoT workflow, written in several languages. 

With our server side demo, the following functions are available:
- Turn on/off diode, which is connected with RPi's GPIO interface;

## C

We make use of the following libraries and the code can be compiled on Raspberry Pi Model B+:

- [udp/json-parser](https://github.com/udp/json-parser)
- [eclipse/paho.mqtt.c](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c)
